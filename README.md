# Deep learning grant free active user detection
Code impletation of grant free active user detection based on deep learning

## Requirements
* Tensorflow 2
* Numpy
* Numba
* be careful the conflict of tensorflow and numba support different numpy version
## Files
* main_DNN: Deep Neural Network-Based Active User Detection for Grant-Free NOMA Systems

  large scale fading isn't included in this code.
* main_AUE: Enumeration and Identification of Active Users for Grant-Free NOMA Using Deep Neural Networks
